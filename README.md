# iOS Car Dashboard app

I made this app to replace my car's center display. It receive data from the car's CAN bus using an Arduino board, connected to an iPhone over Bluetooth. The iPhone is connected to an LCD screen via an HDMI adapter.

See this [blog post](https://medium.com/@alexandreblin/can-bus-reverse-engineering-with-arduino-and-ios-5627f2b1709a) for more information. The Arduino sketch is available [here](https://github.com/alexandreblin/arduino-peugeot-can).
